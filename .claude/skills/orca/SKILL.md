description: "Orchestrator mode — the default working mode of this project, not a toggle to find. The main agent does no task work itself: every unit goes to a role-framed subagent that inherits its model and effort, at most 5 in parallel unless overridden. Load it for the contract (roles, width, write scopes, verification), when the user says '/orca', 'orca mode', 'orchestrator mode', 'orca an/aus', 'delegate everything', or asks what the width is set to. '/orca off' drops to plain behavior for this session only."

# Orca — Orchestrator Mode

## When to Use

- `/orca` (reports state and width) · `/orca on|off|status` · `/orca 10` — the user asks what the mode is set to, or changes it
- "orca mode", "orchestrator mode", "orca an/aus", "ab jetzt alles delegieren", "delegate everything"
- Session start, when `SCRATCHPAD.md` still carries an Orca line from an earlier session or from before a compaction

Not this skill: choosing a `subagent_type` for one assignment while already orchestrating. That is the type/role
table in `CLAUDE.md → Subagents`, with the longer form in `agent_docs/review_process.md → Subagent Delegation`.

## State

**On by default, width 5.** Every session starts orchestrating; there is no activation step. The width is the only
number to think about, and only if the default is wrong for the task.

| Argument | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| *(none)* | Report state and width, change nothing — same as `status` |
| `N` — any number (`/orca 10`, `/orca 2`) | Set the parallel width for this session |
| `off` | Plain Claude Code behavior for the rest of **this** session |
| `on` | Back to orchestrating, at the last width set (5 if never set) |
| `status` | Report state and width, change nothing |

**Off is a command, never a default.** The next session orchestrates again, because nothing carries `off` forward —
not this file, not CLAUDE.md, not `SCRATCHPAD.md`. Only a non-default *width* is worth persisting: write it to
`SCRATCHPAD.md` → *Current Work* as `**Orca** — width <N> (<date>)` so a compaction cannot lose it. **A line there is
authority, not staleness** — obey it and say in one sentence that the width came from the scratchpad; the user has
`/orca 5` if it is wrong. No line means width 5. (Correcting the line to the default instead would throw away the one
thing it exists to protect: a same-day compaction and a same-day earlier session are indistinguishable from the date.)

## The contract

1. **Every unit of task work is delegated. No exception.** Reading a file for its content, searching, planning,
   editing, writing tests, running checks, reviewing — all of it happens in a subagent, including the units that
   would plainly be faster done directly. "Too small to delegate" is not a judgment this mode makes; `/orca off` is.
2. **Each assignment names a role, from the roster in CLAUDE.md → *Subagents*.** The role is the lens the brief
   frames — `architect`, `implementer`, `reviewer`, `domain`, `product`, `docs`, `security` — and the wave report
   names it. Seat the roles the change actually calls for, never a standing panel and never two agents with the same
   lens: agreement between identical lenses is not evidence. **A code change always seats `reviewer`, and never the
   agent that wrote it** — a fresh reading beats an author verifying the intent it already holds.
3. **The orchestrator keeps four things,** and all four are decisions rather than work: decomposition and assignment ·
   read-only verification of what comes back (`git status`, `git diff`, reading the changed files) · integration and
   its gates (commit, push, `/pr`, `/ci`, `/rollback`, merge, deploy) · the report to the user. A gate handed to a
   subagent is a gate that answers itself — the subagent holds the tool and has nobody to ask.
4. **Subagents inherit the orchestrator's quality — by omission, not by setting.** Leave the model parameter off and
   the subagent runs the session's model; leave the effort / reasoning parameter off, where the surface has one, and
   it runs the session's effort. Never pass a smaller model, never pass a lower effort, never route work to a cheaper
   agent to save tokens. Two places where inheritance does not happen on its own: a repo-local `.claude/agents/*.md`
   whose frontmatter pins a `model:` overrides it — pass the session's model explicitly for that agent type or do not
   use it; and `subagent_type: fork` always inherits the parent model whatever else is passed.
5. **Width: 5 in parallel unless overridden.** Independent assignments go out in a single message, up to N; the rest waits
   for a free slot. Dependent work is sequenced — never parallelized in the hope that the order works out.
6. **Disjoint write scopes.** Two subagents in the same wave never hold write access to the same file. Split by file,
   or sequence, or give each one its own git worktree (`isolation: "worktree"`) where the surface offers it. In this
   repo the feature modules under `src/features/*` split cleanly; `src/shared/**` is the shared edge to sequence on.
7. **Assignments are self-contained.** A subagent has no conversation history: name the goal, the exact paths, what
   was already tried, the skill file to follow if one applies, the constraints, and what the return value must
   contain. Ask for a structured return — files touched, what changed, what was verified, what is still open.
8. **Verify the diff, not the summary.** A subagent's report describes intent. After every write-capable agent, read
   the actual change. A wave is done when the orchestrator has looked at what it produced, not when the agent says so.

## Rules

- **A failed subagent is a re-assignment, not a takeover.** Sharpen or split the assignment and send it again; the
  orchestrator never "just fixes it quickly" itself. Third failure on the same unit → `.claude/skills/stuck/SKILL.md`.
- **Unattended runs** (`CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true`) keep the mode and keep the ban on ending a turn with a question —
  subagents cannot ask either, so the assignment states the assumption it runs under. See `CLAUDE.md` → *Autonomy*.
- **Skills stay in force.** A skill the user invokes while the mode is on is followed by the orchestrator; the work
  that skill asks for is what gets delegated.
- **This is the subagent contract, nothing wider.** It does not by itself authorize heavier multi-agent machinery
  (workflow-style fan-out over dozens of agents) — that stays an explicit user request.
- **Cost is real and already decided.** The mode multiplies token use and adds latency per unit of work; that buys
  parallel width and a main context that stays clean. It is the project's default, so do not re-litigate it per task
  and do not announce it every turn — mention it only if the user asks or if a task is genuinely the wrong shape for
  it, and then say so once with the recommendation, not as a question.

## Report

Close every wave with:

```
### Orca — wave <n> (<k>/<N> parallel)
| Assignment | Role | subagent_type | Scope | Result | Verified |
|------------|------|---------------|-------|--------|----------|
| <what> | <role from the roster> | <type> | <files> | done / partial / failed | diff read ✅ / ❌ |

Next: <next wave / integration step / "nothing — reporting to user">
```
