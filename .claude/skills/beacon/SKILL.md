name: beacon
description: Dependency health check + update proposal through the beacon compatibility server. Trigger: /beacon, "check dependencies", "dependency updates", "update deps", or a scheduled/autonomous maintenance run. Starts from beacon-tracked Dependabot proposals when the project is GitHub-connected. Interactive sessions only PROPOSE updates; autonomous runs apply ONLY safe same-major (minor/patch) updates that beacon does not flag.

# beacon — check the stack, propose updates, apply only what is safe

Goal: use the beacon MCP tools (`compat_*`) to (1) pick up the Dependabot proposals beacon
already tracks, (2) check THIS project’s current stack, (3) propose dependency updates with
beacon’s verdicts attached, and (4) apply them — all of them only when the user picked
them; ONLY the safe subset when running autonomously.

## 1 · Verify identity (every run)

- Call `compat_whoami` and confirm it agrees with this repo ("fo0/tubetrend", i.e.
  `git remote get-url origin`). Exactly two results are OK:
  - `project: "fo0/tubetrend"` — a token bound to THIS project; or
  - `declares_project: true` — the shared master/onboarding token, bound to no project:
    then every call below MUST carry `project:"fo0/tubetrend"` (`repo:` on report/observe),
    which is what attributes the run. This skill already passes it everywhere.
- Any other `project` → STOP and tell the user to re-onboard via beacon’s /onboard page;
  never write under another project’s token.

## 2 · Start from tracked proposals (GitHub-connected projects)

- Call `compat_proposals` with `project:"fo0/tubetrend"`: the open Dependabot PRs beacon
  tracks for this repo, each with a pre-computed verdict, reasons, and the PR link. Skip
  this step when the tool is missing or the response says `github.connected` is false.
- Treat every open proposal as an update candidate for step 4 — prepared, not pre-approved:
  beacon’s verdict stays a veto, and the `compat_plan` validation below still applies.
- Never merge or close the Dependabot PR yourself. Apply an accepted bump through this
  repo’s own branch/PR flow (steps 5–6) — Dependabot resolves its PR once the bump lands —
  and record the outcome with `compat_decide` either way.

## 3 · Check the current stack

- Run `compat_check` with `project:"fo0/tubetrend"` and the lock-exact stack (prefer the
  lockfile, e.g. `package-lock.json`; fall back to the manifest).
- Read: `summary`, flagged pairs in `results`, `derived` peer/advisory findings, and
  `recommendations` — beacon’s verified counter-proposals for flagged pairs.

## 4 · Collect update candidates

- Start from the open proposals of step 2 (when present) — that work is already prepared.
- List further available updates with the ecosystem’s tool (npm: `npm outdated --json`;
  adapt for other ecosystems).
- Classify every candidate:
  - **safe** — same-major semver bump (minor/patch) AND beacon flags nothing
    (`risky`/`broken`) for any affected pair.
  - **review** — major bump, non-semver tag change, framework/peer-coupled package
    (react/next/etc.), or beacon flags the target.
- Validate the intended set with `compat_plan` (`project`, current stack, `changes` as
  `{ecosystem, name, from, to}`): read the per-upgrade `upgrades` verdicts and `conflicts`,
  and prefer `recommendations` when a target lands on risky/broken.

## 5 · Interactive session (default)

Change nothing yet. Present a short proposal — safe updates (ready to apply), review
updates (each with beacon’s verdict + reason + recommendation), broken targets (do not
do; say why) — and apply exactly what the user picks. Then close the lifecycle (step 7).

## 6 · Autonomous run (only when explicitly running unattended)

Apply ONLY the safe class, as one small, reviewable batch:

- semver minor/patch within the SAME major — NEVER a major bump, a framework migration,
  or a non-semver tag change;
- drop any candidate whose plan roll-up verdict is `risky`/`broken` or that appears in
  `conflicts` (`unknown` is acceptable for a same-major bump);
- after bumping: install and run this repo’s own checks (typecheck/lint/tests/build);
  on failure revert that bump and record it (`compat_decide` status:"failed" + note);
- follow the repo’s branch/PR conventions — never commit straight to main;
- majors and review candidates stay a WRITTEN proposal (PR description or issue).

## 7 · Close the lifecycle (both modes)

- Re-run `compat_check` with `project:"fo0/tubetrend"` and the new stack — it syncs the
  project dashboard and auto-marks planned upgrades `applied`.
- Verified something beacon did not know (an unknown/flagged pair now proven)? Write back
  ONE tight-range `compat_report` rule (`repo:"fo0/tubetrend"`) for the pair you actually
  exercised — never blanket-report every routine bump.
- Updates you decided against — or that failed — record with `compat_decide`
  (`project:"fo0/tubetrend"`, `rejected`/`failed`/`abandoned` + note), so the project
  dashboard shows why.
