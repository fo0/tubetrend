# Example environment variables for this Vite app
#
# Usage:
# 1) Copy this file to ".env.local"
# 2) Adjust values as needed for your local setup
#
# Notes:
# - Vite only exposes variables prefixed with "VITE_" to the client.
# - If a variable is left empty, the app may use its own internal fallback.

# Default search value shown in the input field when the app loads.
# If not set, the app will use these fallbacks:
#   - Dev mode: "TEDx"
#   - Production: "" (empty)
# Example: VITE_DEFAULT_SEARCH=TEDx
VITE_DEFAULT_SEARCH=
