# Backlog Process

Review findings that were not immediately fixed are tracked in `BACKLOG.md` in the project root.

## Rules

1. **Backlog is memory, not a task queue** — items are ONLY worked on upon explicit user request. Never work through the backlog independently.
2. New entries go under `## Open`.
3. No duplicates — check if finding already exists before adding.
4. Done items move from `## Open` to `## Done` with completion date.
5. Stale entries — if the referenced function/component changed through other work, check if the finding is still relevant. Update or remove if obsolete.
6. Source traceability — every entry links back to the task/feature where it was found.
7. Escalation — P2 findings that block 3+ different features get escalated to P1.

## BACKLOG.md Format

### Location Format

Use `File -> Function/Component` instead of line numbers. Line numbers go stale after every commit.

### Status Values

- **Deferred** — Recognized as valid, postponed intentionally (reasoning in Finding or Source)
- **Accepted** — Known limitation, accepted as-is for now
- **Escalated** — Upgraded from P2 to P1 due to repeated impact
